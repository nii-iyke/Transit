# Unlocking Insights with Data: Transit Analytics Dashboard

In todayâ€™s world, data-driven decision-making is a game-changer. This project presents a **Transit Analytics Dashboard** that visualizes passenger trends, optimizes operations, and enhances service delivery for transit agencies.

## Key Features of the Dashboard:

- **Trip Time Trend**: Visualizes passenger activity throughout the day to identify peak and down hours.
- **Time-Range Distribution**: Analyzes ridership across time blocks for better scheduling and resource allocation.
- **Bus Utilization**: Analyzes proper, under, and over-utilization rates for efficient fleet management.
- **Rider Metrics**: Displays yearly and monthly distributions, providing insights into the busiest and least busy routes.

## Actionable Insights:

- **Busiest Route**: The **East-West Express** is the busiest route, highlighting the need for resource prioritization.
- **Least Busy Route**: The **South Line** is the least busy, providing an opportunity for route optimization.
- **Peak Times**: The busiest times are between **6 PM - 9 PM**, while **7:50 PM** records the lowest ridership.

## Tools & Technologies:

- **Power BI** for creating the dashboard and visualizations.
- **Data Sources**: Transit ridership data (trip times, bus utilization, and rider metrics).

## How This Dashboard Helps:

By combining data visualization with actionable insights, this dashboard empowers transit agencies to streamline operations and improve the commuter experience. It assists in identifying trends, optimizing scheduling, and making data-driven decisions for better fleet management.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) in Power BI Desktop.
3. Load the data sources into Power BI to refresh and update the visualizations.
4. Customize the visualizations and dashboards based on your specific transit data.

## Future Enhancements:

- Integration with real-time data for live tracking.
- Adding predictive analytics to forecast ridership trends.
- Expanding the dashboard to include more detailed demographic and geospatial data.
